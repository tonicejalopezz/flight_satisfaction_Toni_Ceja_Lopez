# Flight Satisfaction

Customer Flight Satisfaction, leveraging various machine learning methods.

File proj_costumer_satisfaction_preprocess.ipynb contains the first task resulting in preprocessed CSV files.

File proj_customer_satisfaction_ML.ipynb is the second task that performs various machine learning methods.

That is the following: 
  1. Logistic Regression with 2 kernel tricks
  2. SVM with 2 kernel tricks
  3. Decision Tree Classifier 
  4. Random Forest Classifier
  5. Vanilla Neural Network

Resulting in +95% accuracy for Random Forest Classifier, Vanilla Neural Network, and SVM with a Gaussian Kernel.
